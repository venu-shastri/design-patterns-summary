Typical product database consists of two types of product components — product categories and product items. 
A product category is generally  contain product items and also other product categories as its subcategories. Example Product Categories: 
- Computers
- Desktops
- Laptops
- Peripherals 
- Printers
- Cables 
The Computers product category contains both the Desktops and the Laptops product categories as its subcategories. The Desktop category can contain a product item such as Compaq Presario 5050. Product items are usually individual, in the sense that they do not contain any product component within. 
Design and implement an PricingCalculator  to list the dollar value of a product component or Product Category.

# CNC Monitoring and Alerting

We need a solution to interpret data coming out of a _CNC-machine monitor_.
Our purpose is to alert when something needs attention.
The alert needs to include information on the area that needs attention -
the machine or the environment.
The personnel that need to be alerted are different in each case.

A basic idea of CNC machines can be seen [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_control).
Keeping these machines safe and reliable is vital in any manufacturing unit.

## Monitored data

The _CNC-machine monitor_ gives the following data:

- Operating temperature: Temperature around the CNC machine in Celsius.
Reported every half-hour. Need to alert if it goes beyond 35 degrees.

- Part-dimension variation: In mm. A variation of more than 0.05 mm needs attention
(example: a drill-bit in the machine may need replacement)

- Duration of continuous operation: Reported in minutes.
Updated once every 15 minutes.
More than 6 hours of continuous operation requires attention.

- Self-test status-code, reported at startup

| Code | Meaning |
|---:|---|
|0xFF|All ok|
|0x00|No data (examples: no power, no connection to the data-collector)|
|0x01|Controller board in the machine is not ok|
|0x02|Configuration data in the machine is corrupted|

Assume that the above data is monitored and passed-on to your program.
You can choose to take the inputs as function calls to your program, or as events.

## Expected outputs

The program needs to indicate if there is a need for attention.

When there is a need to attend,
it needs to offer an initial diagnosis,
to help in alerting the appropriate personnel:
It needs to convey whether the machine needs attention,
or if its environment needs attention.
